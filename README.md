Random Forest model turns out to be the better model for prediction most
of the time except to data from Sunday, and it can achieve an accuracy
of 60% with optimal parameters here.

The analysis for [Monday is available here](MondayAnalysis.md).

The analysis for [Tuesday is available here](TuesdayAnalysis.md).

The analysis for [Wednesdayu is available here](WednesdayAnalysis.md).

The analysis for [Thursday is available here](ThursdayAnalysis.md).

The analysis for [Friday is available here](FridayAnalysis.md).

The analysis for [Saturday is available here](SaturdayAnalysis.md).

The analysis for [Sunday is available here](SundayAnalysis.md).

The project [Rmd file is here](ST558project2.Rmd)

The R code for [automation is here](knitr.R) or run blow chunk R code.

A table with some selected parameters are listed in below table,
weekendâ€™s data prediction is more accurate and also generally need
less predictors and mTry.

The prediction accurate rate from two model is also compared in the
plot.

``` r
# To produce md output automatically - Need press "run current chunk".
# Create weekday parameter
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")

# Create empty vector holders 
for (i in weekdays) {assign(i , rep(0 ,7))}

# Create summary dataset
if (!exists("resultSummary")) {
resultSummary <- dplyr::as_tibble(matrix(0, ncol=7,nrow=7,
